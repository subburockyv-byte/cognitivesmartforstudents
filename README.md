Cognitive Load Dashboard for Students
Overview

The Cognitive Load Dashboard for Students is an AI-driven study assistant designed to help students manage mental workload, improve focus, and retain information effectively. By combining cognitive science principles with productivity analytics, the platform transforms studying into a data-driven, efficient, and personalized experience.

Students often struggle with burnout, distractions, and ineffective study methods. This dashboard provides real-time insights and intelligent recommendations to optimize learning performance and mental well-being.

Problem

Students face:

cognitive overload from heavy academic demands

poor focus and constant digital distractions

low retention due to ineffective study strategies

burnout from prolonged mental strain

lack of awareness about their cognitive performance

Research shows students forget up to 70% of new information within 24 hours without effective revision strategies.

Solution

The Cognitive Load Dashboard helps students:

monitor cognitive load and stress levels

track focus time and productivity trends

receive AI-powered study and wellness recommendations

reduce burnout through smart break scheduling

improve retention using spaced repetition techniques

visualize subject mastery and learning connections
